# Smart_Battery_Interface
 Implimentation of the SBS Protocol for Arduino
 
 This repository implements the functions of the SBS-protocol used by Ardupilot. 
 The connection to the flight controller happens via I2C.
 
 The flight controller has to be set up for a Maxell Battery: https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-smart-battery.html
